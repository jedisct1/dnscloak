              <h3>What is DNSCrypt?</h3>
              <p>DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It
                prevents
                DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS
                resolver
                and havenâ€™t been tampered with.
              </p>

              <h3>
                What is DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)?</h3>
              <p>DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) is an experimental protocol for performing DNS resolution via the HTTPS protocol.
                The
                goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and
                manipulation
                of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks. Another goal of DoH is to improve performance.
              </p>

              <h3>How the app works?</h3>
              <p>The app runs a local resolver (dnscrypt-proxy v2) in the background that performs DNS resolutions via
                DNSCrypt
                and/or DoH protocols via a user-selected set of resolvers. The app uses a VPN profile to setup the
                whole
                system to use local resolver.</p>

              <h3>How to use the app?</h3>
              <p>Select your preferred resolver(s) and tap start button. First time you will be asked for permission to
                install
                VPN profile. After profile install the app will launch a local resolver and setup iOS to use it as a
                system-wide
                DNS resolver. You may also enable "Connect On Demand" feature to keep the app running and automatically
                restarting.</p>

              <h3>Is the app compatible with VPN apps?</h3>
              <p>Preamble: all network configurations on the iOS are made using "VPN profiles". There are two main
                profile types:
                "enterprise" (listed as "VPN Configurations" in Settings -&gt; VPN, top of the form) and "personal"
                (listed
                as "Personal VPN" in Settings -&gt; VPN, bottom of the form). iOS allows only a single profile per type
                to
                be active. Enterprise profile superseeds personal profile. Our app is made as a special subtype of
                enterprise
                profile. ANSWER: So, if other app's profile is listed as "Personal VPN" one - it is probably
                compatible,
                if it is listed in "VPN Configurations" section (DNSCloak's profile listed there) - it is not
                compatible.</p>

              <h3>Is the app compatible with iOS Personal Hotspot mode?</h3>
              <p>No. Personal Hotspot launches a local resolver thus causing a port conflict with the app.</p>

              <h3>Does the app support multiple resolvers usage?</h3>
              <p>Yes, you can select specific resolvers (or keep your selection empty to use the whole list).
              </p>

              <h3>How to determine fastest resolver(s)?</h3>
              <p>App will check RTT for each resolver and will pick candidate based on configurable load balancing
                strategy.
                Default strategy is to pick candidate randomly from top two fastest. Other strategies are descibed
                <a class="external" href="https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Load-Balancing-Options">here</a>.
                Also, you can enable and view service log - app will print RTT for each used resolver. You can
                use this infromation to adjust the selection.

              <h3>I have selected a resolver provided by famous company, run a synthetic DNS leak test, but it displays
                my ISP's
                resolver. Why?
              </h3>
              <p>This is a known situation due to mix of edge cases:
                <ol>
                  <li>Synthetic DNS leak tests launch large number (hundreds) of simultaneous randomized uncached
                    requests;</li>
                  <li>Resolvers of large companies do rate limiting, thus failing that requests;</li>
                  <li>iOS catches that failed responses and fallbacks to system resolver - your ISP's resolver.</li>
                </ol>

              <h3>I have IPv4-only connectivity on my home/work WiFi and IPv6-only connectivity on my carrier's

                to setup your app?
              </h3>
              <p>DNSCloak allows the use of multiple resolvers and checks your connectivity type on network changes.
                So, you
                can select both IPv4 and IPv6 resolvers (IPv6 resolvers have "-ipv6" suffix in their names) and the app
                will switch them automatically.</p>
